          I learned a lot in this quarter. Not just typing random stuf on a keyboard, but how to code properly and make a website/webpage. At first, the lessons were easy. But as time passes by and many lessons were introduced, I was a bit challenged mainly because of memorization. There are lots of differenced between grade 8 me and grade 9 me. They are in terms of knowledge, mastery, skills, and creativity in designing a webpage. But even though I have already improved a lot, I believe I still have room for improvement. I will make sure that I will do better in the next quarters to make up for my low scores and to increase my knowledge in coding. I find coding fun, but sometimes it's stressful. Maybe because of time pressure, or just because I couldn't figure out how to make things work. <br> <br>

I could say I learned a lot because I did not just review some random terms and then hope for the best. We had hands-on sessions which made me experience coding beforehand and had prepared me to make this website. This website may not be the best, but just know that I put in a lot of effort to make it. Not just the lessons 1-8, but I also learned about putting images, audios, and videos in webpages which came very handy especially it's a bit confusing for beginners like me. Of course I don't expect much for myself, but I'm lowkey proud of myself for making it this far in a very cool journey. <br> <br>

And of course, as a part of life, I also went through ups and downs. I did not always pass the test and exams. Luckily, I have some friends/classmates and a teacher who helped me whenever I found something difficult to understand. <br> <br>

 Overall, I am very thankful for the experience and knowledge that I earned. I hope to learn more and improve my coding skills in the next quarters. <br> <br> <br> <form action="TEST.html" method="post">
